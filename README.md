An Avatar, slightly bouncing appears on the screen<br>
Who's Avatar?<br>
A presumption is made<br>
A male presenting figure stares back at me, bouncing<br>
The instant drive to recreate my body swarms me<br>
Tab after tab of alterations and editing options surround him<br>
My thumbs dance around the controller, considering and selecting<br>
I begin the godly process<br>
The Adam and Eve like shift from 'male' to 'female' is simulated<br>
A female presenting protagonist is born<br>
I stare back at the third version of myself<br>
There is a strong dissociation between me and my virtual represent<br>
I am defined by a character assumed by someone other to me<br>
Currently a slim, brown haired, white, female presenting avatar<br>
I admire her appearance whilst I take the journey through the interface of modifications<br>
From blush to olive, through to caramel... sweet dark honey to sweet dark chocolate<br>
The bitter struggle of resisting the categories begins<br>
Becoming embodied in countless renditions until I find *my* sweet spot<br>
Virtually simulating my flesh; my melanin becomes a series of binary numbers<br>
A grouping of tiny brown pixels<br>
The quest through the endless menus continue<br>
Versions upon versions are created<br>
I watch my virtual body shift from slim to fat and I wonder about an existence beyond the boundaries<br>
I settle for the slim build with tits the size of watermelons<br>
*My* hair is a collection of ringlets, some moisturised to perfection, some left to
create a halo of frizz that surround my head<br>
The medium length beach hair will have to do this time<br>
Each delicate strand of my tangled main becomes a block of poorly rendered
mush<br>
